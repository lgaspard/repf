# Renewable Energy Production Forecast

Nowadays, renewable energies, such as wind and solar power, are playing an increasingly important role in the global production of electrical energy.

Unfortunately, these new energy sources are very dependent on the weather and time conditions. Therefore, it is sometimes hard to forecast their production and, consequently, to adapt adequately the non-renewable sources production, such as nuclear centrals.

As its name suggests, this project aimed at forecasting, as accurately as possible, the renewable energy production in the province of Liège.

The results are showcased at [lgaspard.github.io/repf](https://lgaspard.github.io/repf/).

Project realized by *Yann Claes*, *Gaspard Lambrechts* and *François Rozet*.

Under the direction of *Bertrand Cornelusse*, *Pierre Geurts* and *Gilles Louppe*.
